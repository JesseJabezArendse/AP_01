# Sensor Board Usage Guide

To set up and run the Sensor Board, follow these steps:

1. **Program the Sensor Board:**
   - Copy the respective `.bin` file to the `NOD_F411` drive. This will program the board with the necessary firmware.

2. **Set Up the Simulink Model:**
   - Open the `.slx` file in Simulink.
   - Verify that the correct **COM Port** is selected for both communication blocks to ensure proper data exchange.

3. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Once the setup is complete, run the `.slx` file as a simulation to initiate data flow with the Sensor Board.
